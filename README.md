<h3 align="center">Stake & Play chess on web2 platforms</h3>


------------------------------------------

> We ring a `Decentralized settlement layer` on top of popular web2 chess platforms like `Lichess` to enhance the playing experience by giving users the ability to stake ERC-20 tokens and play with the `interface they are very familiar` with.

------------------------------------------
#### Deployed - Kovan Testnet (beta release only)

- Website to download extension: https://www.chessverse.xyz/
- Devfolio Submission: https://devfolio.co/submissions/chessverse-64a1




------------------------------------------

#### Thought Process

- We wanted to build something which was scalable and be used with minimum 'ifs' in the present and not is some future with minimum learning curve.
- We explored around creating new chess platform to forming a DAO out of it, all of these seem to be very "Theoretical".
- We stumbled on the vision of a web extension which can essentially be a zero interface product, and get the work done,
- We simply loved the idea and tried to deliver a initial beta version of our vision.
- We plan to extend the support to platforms like Chess.com and and also include it for tournaments.
