#### Thought Process

- We wanted to build something which was scalable and be used with minimum 'ifs' in the present and not is some future with minimum learning curve.
- We explored around creating new chess platform to forming a DAO out of it, all of these seem to be very "Theoretical".
- We stumbled on the vision of a web extension which can essentially be a zero interface product, and get the work done,
- We simply loved the idea and tried to deliver a initial beta version of our vision.
- We plan to extend the support to platforms like Chess.com and and also include it for tournaments.
